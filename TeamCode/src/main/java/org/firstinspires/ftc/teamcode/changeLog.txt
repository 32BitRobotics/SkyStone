Here's some stuff we need to change:

Diameter of wheels

Counts per revolution of each motor:
    This will be different for each motor setup i.e: drive motors vs arm motors
    Be sure to take into account the fact that the counts/rev for each motor is on the input motor, NOT THE OUTPUT.
    Make a function to move the robot a certain distance
        Probably same thing for the arm
